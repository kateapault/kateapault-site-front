            TL;DR: I'm a mechE-turned-techie and I love to make stuff.
            </p>
            <p>I started out as a mechanical engineer with a BSME from Georgia Tech.
            Specializing in product development and R&D, I worked in several industries 
            making products as diverse as fireproof cables and roller coaster trolleys.
            Programming always snuck its way in - I edited post processors in JavaScript
            and wrote bash + python scripts to automate work tasks like comparing different
            versions of bills of materials. Getting downsized at my most recent role was the
            perfect opportunity to jump into programming full time. I threw myself into Flatiron 
            School and made a ton of side projects to practice, and I'm now looking for a job.
            </p>

            Idk, I know this is not a great summary, but please hire me. I learn fast and I'm great 
            at working to deadlines, and I already have experience with product development (albeit 
            with rubber rather than Ruby). In the first two weeks you have me as a junior engineer I'll
            ask tons of questions, help tidy up product documentation (I'm good at that - I helped with 
            issue & product documentation at Autodesk for Fusion 360!), and start learning the hell out of
            your stack. 
            </p>
        </div>
